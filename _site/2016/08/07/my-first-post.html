<h1>My First Post</h1>
<p>August 07, 2016</p>
<p>So, might as well get this out there to start. I never thought that I would have a blog. I abhor the idea of talking about myself.
  Seeing how I have little say in this experiment I might as well make the best of it.
</p>

<p>
  So where to really start? The typical bio seems too rudimentary so let's do something more... personal? I love cars. I grew up with my dad
  racing on weekends so I grew up in speed shops, working on cars, etc. There's something pure about cars. They work or they dont. They dont
  give you attitude and, at least for me, they allow a great deal of personal expression. I currently own a 2004 Volkswagon Golf R32 in Black
  Magic Peral (BMP). Her name is Sheila and post Turing I have a grand plan for her that will mean she can pull about 450 bhp and roughly that
  in torque.
</p>

<p>This is not my car but it gives you an idea of what she looks like.</p>

  The other thing that I am pasionate about is politics.  There goes most readers ("O shit, he's going to go on some rampage about this party or that
  one!"). The truth is politics are interesting. I am an Independent, though registered Republican. I am a direct decendent of a founding father and
  I take that to heart. I think that the citizenry should always keep the governemtn in check and as of late (let's just say since roughtly the 80's)
  we have failed spectaculary at that task. I have a background in economics and loved learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Game Theory</a>.
  Through that lens I enjoy waching elections and how people react.
